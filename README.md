### PROJECT TITLE: Project Title

Welcome to the repository for our Capstone project at Norquest College. This project aims to predict the enrolments of the Interdisciplinary Therapy Assistant Program in specific years. 

### Problem Statement

The ITA program data is extracted from the given college dataset. And, the aim of this dataset is to predict the enrolments of ITA students in different semesters or years.

### Solution

A total of three machine Learning Models are used to solve the problem of enrolment prediction including Auto ML as well. The other two models are the Logistic Regressor and XG Boost Classifier. In the end, The XG Boost classifier is selected for further use because of its good accuracy, precision, or recall scores.

### Repository Structure

The repository contains the following files:

data.csv: The ITA data set contains 466 records total and 34 columns including the target variable. After cleaning, some of the features are selected for further use. 
app.py: App.py files contain all the information that is needed to deploy the model. App.py file is like a prototype or copy of an original model that is made to predict the enrolment of students. This files contains EDA, Cleaning, important features, applied model and predictions of enrollment on different values of features.
requirements.txt: This file contains the data of libraries that are used for making the model such as sci-kit-learn, pandas, numpy, and so on.

### Getting Started

To get started with our project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. The dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file.
